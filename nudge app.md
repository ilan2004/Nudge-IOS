# üß† Nudge ‚Äî Concept Overview

Nudge is a gamified productivity app that personalizes focus using your MBTI personality type.

‚ÄúFocus isn‚Äôt one-size-fits-all ‚Äî it‚Äôs personal.‚Äù

Instead of enforcing rigid productivity systems, Nudge adapts to you ‚Äî how your mind works, how you recharge, and how you stay on track.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Core Mechanics (How It Works)

### 1) Character Selection (MBTI Integration)
- The MBTI personality quiz becomes a ‚Äúcharacter selection‚Äù moment ‚Äî like starting a game.
- The test assigns one of 16 MBTI types, a character avatar, and a personality profile.
- Your character influences:
  - UI theme
  - Motivational nudges
  - Focus flow
  - Data visualization

### 2) Smart Blocking (Distraction Control Engine)
- Integrates with OS-level blocking APIs to reduce distractions during focus mode:
  - iOS: FamilyControls framework
  - Android: UsageStats + Accessibility permissions
- During focus mode, selected apps (e.g., Instagram, YouTube) are blocked.

### 3) Focus Sessions & Gamified Scoring
- Modes:
  - Solo focus sessions
  - Group focus challenges
- Each session tracks:
  - Total Focus Time ‚è±Ô∏è
  - Breaks taken
  - Distraction attempts
  - Consistency streaks
- Generates Focus Points to build your profile and level up your character.
- Social features:
  - Compete with friends for top focus scores
  - Collaborate in shared focus sessions
  - Real-time Leaderboard
- Goal: subtle social incentive ‚Äî competition without pressure.

### 4) Profile Dashboard
- Shows:
  - Personality Type & Character Avatar
  - Total Focus Hours
  - Focus Points & Weekly Trends
  - Active Streaks
  - Leaderboard Rank among friends
- Feels like a personal stats screen for real-life focus.

### 5) Visual & Emotional Feedback
- Clean, theme-based visuals that change with your MBTI type.
- Micro animations when milestones hit (e.g., ‚ÄúFlow Unlocked‚Äù).
- Mood-based background shifts (e.g., sunset tones near session completion).
- Outcome: emotional resonance with every focus win.

### 6) Underground Mode (Privacy / Stealth Layer)
- ‚ÄúPrivate training mode‚Äù for silent progress.
- Hides focus hours and points from public leaderboards.
- Still shows screen time for self-accountability.
- You continue accumulating Focus XP internally.
- Visibility can be toggled back on anytime.
- Designed for introverts, private achievers, and anyone who prefers control without isolation.

## Mock Data ‚Äî Friends

### Data Schema
```swift
struct Friend: Identifiable, Codable {
    let id: UUID
    let name: String
    let personalityType: PersonalityType  // ENUM: One of 16 MBTI types (e.g., .intj, .enfp)
    let gender: Gender                    // ENUM: .male, .female, .nonBinary
    let relationshipType: RelationshipType // ENUM: .closeFriend, .friend, .acquaintance
    let focusPoints: Int                  // Total focus points earned
    let streakDays: Int                   // Current streak in days
    let dailyScreenTimeHours: Double      // Average daily screen time
    let avgSessionLengthMinutes: Int      // Average focus session length
    let totalFocusHours: Double           // Total lifetime focus hours
    let rank: Int                         // Leaderboard position
}
```
